# Jessie Coney

i.	Hi, Iâ€™m Jessie! I am a graduate of Eastern Washington University with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Visual Communication Design along with a User Experience Design Certificate and an art minor.

I have worked for multiple companies completing a variety of design projects. My experience ranges from social media marketing in the hospitality industry and redesigning catalogs for an industrial company, to brand photography and graphic design for a small in-house agency and graphic design collateral for a larger in-house design department.

I love to travel and aspire to travel the world one day. I have travelled across the United States and have also traveled to Canada, Japan, and China. Yet there is still much of the world I have left to explore. I believe that travelling the world exposes me to the design styles of different cultures. I am fascinated with different cultures and design styles and I believe that in order to be a better designer, one should strive to see as many different styles as they can.
