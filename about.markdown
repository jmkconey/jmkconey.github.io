Hi, i ªm Jessie! I am an Eastern Washington University (EWU) graduate and have a BA in Visual Communication Design, certificate in User Experience (UX) Design, as well as an art minor. I have worked for multiple companies in Hawaii as well as Washington in some type of design aspect doing a variety of things from photography to social media marketing.I believe traveling the world is pertinent to fully understand and design for the world.
