excerpt: Travis Pattern and Foundry is an engineering company who produces a catalog
  every 2 years with updated prices. It was my job to make the catalog cohesive and
  updated with the new information.

**Client:** Travis Pattern and Foundry

**Date:** August 2018

**Description:**  This catalog was started many years ago by one of the boss's of the company who had very little knowledge of inDesign or even simple design concepts. I first tackled this issue by making a list of everything that was obviously wrong with the catalog. After completing multiple iterations of this catalog I was able to reach a point where both I and the client were satisfied with the results. I was able to change the UX for not only the customer using this catalog in the future but also for the designer who will take on this project in the future.
