**Client:** EWU Student Research & Creative Works Symposium

**Date:** May 2017

**Description:** The SMART session provides a unique opportunity to bring EWU professional to share their activities across a diverse audience. The event connects those involved in successful mentoring, administration, advising, arts, research and teaching to EWU’s three-tiered strategic plan. It was my goal to create a logo that embodied all of these ideas.
