**Client:** Don's Big Island Towing
**Date:** October 2018
**Description:** Don’s Towing is a company located in Volcano, HI and although it has been around for 30+ years it’s various pieces of collateral such as their business cards were not uniform with the look they were trying to strive for. My goal was to create a uniform brand, brand guidelines, as well as a variety of collateral that followed the new guidelines. The collateral included things such as business cards and a variety of stickers.
