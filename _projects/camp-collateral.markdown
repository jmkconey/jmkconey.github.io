**Client:** EWU College Assistant Migrant Program
**Date:** October 2017
**Description:** The EWU College Assistant Migrant Program (CAMP) was in search of creating a new recruitment piece. This piece needed to highlight what CAMP has done for previous students as well as the overall benefits that it could provide future students. The last page includes a perforated panel so that after recruiters hand out the piece, if a student or family has any questions they would be able to easily fill it out.
